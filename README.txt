This project is inspired by FiveThirtyEight's survey about when the four seasons
begin: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-very-unscientific-poll-on-when-each-season-starts/

I thought that many of the markers they suggest to start the seasons don't
really work for Minnesota, especially for winter.

For example, they suggested "When the first snow falls" or "When the first snow 
sticks to the ground" as markers for the start of winter. Obviously, in 
Minnesota, the first true snowfall is frequently in late October. Anyone who 
remembers the Halloween Blizzard of 1991 will enthusiastically tell you about 
it.

They also suggest March 1 as a start date for spring. We all know that March 1
is, for all intents and purposes, still winter. Traditionally, the Anishinaabe 
(aka Ojibwe or Chippewa) in Minnesota refer to March on the lunar calendar as 
"Hard Crust on the Snow" - not very springy.

I decided to calculate the start and end of each season purely by the average
high temperature each day in the Twin Cities area. For example, the day of the 
year with the highest average temperature would represent the middle of summer, 
and the day of the year with the lowest average temperature would represent the 
middle of winter. The start and end of each season could be calculated based on 
that, instead of seasonal markers that only make sense on the East Coast.

Included is an R script for how I accomplished this. It is probably not the most
simple and efficient way to do this, so I will hopefully learn more and edit it
in the future!
